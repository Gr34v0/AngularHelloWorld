				I have very little experience in web technology. Over both of my COOPs I was tasked with nearly exclusively
				backend development, but I was briefly exposed to HTML/CSS/JS in my first, and I developed a REST API and
				utilized said API on my second. I wish to learn as much as I can about web development as I can so that I am
				no longer in the dark about the subject.

				Star Trek is one of my favorite things, and thus I thought it would be appropriate to add a picture of the
				latest iteration of Star Trek as my "favorite thing" image.
